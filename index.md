# Blending algorithms and Bayesian machine learning in computational biology.

The EL GATO Lab at UConn was founded in 2018 and includes researchers with a wide range of interests and specialties. Our research aims to develop probabilistic machine learning models, combinatorial algorithms, and scalable inference methods to better understand high-dimensional data, particularly genomics and genetics data applied to complex disease.
